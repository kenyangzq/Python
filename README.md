# Python
This repository contains some of my practice code in python 2.7.1 and python 3.5.1.
I learned python myself in both versions. I started with the book name the Hard Way to Learn Python. It's pretty useful and I have push some of my practice in the book to the repository. 
After I learn the basic of Python, I also did some exercise on ProjectEuler website, which has a lot of interesting and challenging problems. In ProjectEuler.py, I list some of the solutions to the problems.
